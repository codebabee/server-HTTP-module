        <p>I'm a student at the university of uyo, akwa ibom state, nigeria. I'm currently in my 400 level and would be entering my final year by december, 2022. I love to sing, pray and travel. Most of all, i love to code that's why i'm pursuing a career in frontend development. I have 4 sisters and a bestfriend whom i love so much.</p>
